## R Markdown

**This** is an *R Markdown* `document`. ~~Markdown~~ is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

> When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Shopping list:

1. eggs
    + bread
    + eggs
      + eggs
2. bread


```{r cars, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(mtcars)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dt <- read.table(
  "data.csv",
  sep = ",",
  header = TRUE,
  row.names = 1
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(dt)
```

![](fed.jpeg)

```{r, fig.align='center', out.height='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fed.jpeg")
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
